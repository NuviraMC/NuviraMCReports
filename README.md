# Official Documentation

## Overview

NuviraMCReports is a modern, robust reporting system designed for Minecraft servers that require structured moderation workflows. It enables players to submit reports easily while providing staff with powerful tools to review, manage, and resolve reports efficiently. The plugin is optimized for performance, supports multiple GUI styles, integrates with Discord, and scales seamlessly across single servers and networks.

---

## Region Restriction

**NuviraMCReports** is designed to be used globally; however, please note that the plugin is **restricted and will not function** on servers located within **Israel**. This is enforced via automated IP/timezone verification.

## 4. Report Workflow

1. A player submits a report using `/report`
2. Staff members receive instant notifications
3. Report is marked as **Pending**
4. Staff review the report via the Admin GUI
5. Report is marked as **Resolved** or **Rejected**

All actions are logged and synchronized across servers when using MySQL.

---

## 5. Configuration (`config.yml`)

This section documents every available option in `config.yml`, explaining its purpose and recommended usage.

---

### Config Version System

```yaml
# Please Do not change the config version
config-version: 5
```

The `config-version` field is used by NuviraMCReports to **automatically manage and migrate your configuration** when the plugin is updated to a newer version that requires changes to `config.yml`.

#### How It Works

1. When the plugin loads, it reads the `config-version` value from your existing `config.yml`.
2. It compares that value against the version bundled inside the current plugin `.jar`.
3. **If they match**: No migration is needed. The plugin proceeds normally.
4. **If the bundled version is higher**: The plugin automatically:
   - Creates a backup of your existing file as `config.yml.old`.
   - Migrates all your existing settings (server name, database credentials, Discord token, etc.) into the new structure.
   - Writes a fresh `config.yml` with all new required fields, preserving your data.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Never manually edit the `config-version` field.** Changing it will cause the plugin to skip or repeat migrations, which can corrupt your configuration. If you need to reset the config, simply delete `config.yml` and restart the server.

> [!TIP]
> Your old config is always safely backed up as `config.yml.old` before any migration runs. If something goes wrong, you can restore your settings from that file.

---

### 5.0 Language Settings

```yaml
language: "en_US"
```

- Sets the active language file loaded from the `plugins/NuviraMCReports/lang/` folder.
- The value must match a `.yml` filename inside that folder (without the extension).
- **Built-in languages** (automatically extracted on first startup):
  - `en_US` – English (default)
  - `it_IT` – Italian
  - `sk_SK` – Slovak
  - `pl_PL` – Polish
  - `zh_CN` – Simplified Chinese
- **Custom language files**: You can create your own `.yml` file inside the `lang/` folder.
  - Custom files are **never overwritten** by plugin updates.
  - Any keys missing in a custom file will automatically fall back to `en_US` values, so the plugin will never break due to untranslated strings.
  - A console warning will list any missing keys to help you keep translations up to date.

---

### 5.1 Server Configuration

```yaml
server-name: "survival"
```

- **server-name**: Identifies the server in multi-server setups.
  - Must be unique when multiple servers share the same database.
  - Displayed in Discord embeds and network-wide logs.

---

### 5.2 Database Configuration

```yaml
database:
  type: "file" # mysql or file
```

#### Database Types

- **file**: Uses local SQLite storage (recommended for single servers).
- **mysql**: Enables cross-server synchronization for networks.

#### MySQL Settings

```yaml
mysql:
  host: "localhost"
  port: 3306
  database: "aevorin_reports"
  username: "root"
  password: "password"
```

- Used only when `type` is set to `mysql`.
- All servers must share the same credentials for synchronization.

#### File Storage

```yaml
file:
  path: "database/reports.db"
```

- Location of the SQLite database file.

#### Connection Pool (Advanced)

```yaml
pool:
  minimum-idle: 5
  maximum-pool-size: 10
  connection-timeout: 30000
```

- Optimizes database performance.
- Recommended to leave defaults unless tuning is required.

---

### 5.3 Report Settings

```yaml
reports:
  allow-self-reporting: false
```

- Prevents players from reporting themselves when disabled.

#### GUI Configuration

```yaml
gui:
  type: "book" # book or container
```

- **book**: Classic book-style interface.
- **container**: Modern chest-style GUI.

#### Limits & Cooldowns

```yaml
cooldown: 300
max-active-reports: 3
```

- **cooldown**: Time (seconds) between report submissions.
- **max-active-reports**: Maximum unresolved reports per player.

#### Custom Reasons

```yaml
allow-custom-reasons: true
custom-reason-min-length: 10
custom-reason-max-length: 100
```

- Allows players to submit custom reasons via chat.
- Length limits prevent spam and abuse.

#### Report Categories

```yaml
categories:
  - "Hacking/Cheating"
  - "Harassment/Bullying"
  - "Spam/Advertisement"
```

- Displayed in the report GUI.
- Categories are fully customizable.

---

### 5.4 Notification Settings

```yaml
notifications:
  new-report: true
  status-change: true
  sound: "BLOCK_NOTE_BLOCK_PLING"
```

- **new-report**: Notify staff when a report is created.
- **status-change**: Notify staff when report status changes.
- **sound**: Sound played for staff alerts (empty string disables).

#### Chat Prefix

The chat prefix, which appears before most plugin messages, is configured within the **language files** to allow for localized branding.

```yaml
# Found in lang/en_US.yml
messages:
  prefix: "&8[&bNuviraMCReports&8]&r "
```

---

### 5.5 Update Checker

```yaml
update-checker:
  check-interval: 60
  notify-on-join: true
```

- Automatically checks for new plugin versions.
- Notifies authorized players on join.

---

### 5.6 Debug Settings

debug:
  enabled: false
  log-queries: false
```

- **enabled**: Enables detailed debug logging.

---

### 5.7 Message Customization

```yaml
messages:
  report-created: "&aYour report has been submitted successfully!"
```

- Fully customizable messages.
- Supports color codes (`&`) and placeholders.
- MiniMessage is supported where applicable.

---

### 5.8 Discord Integration

```yaml
discord:
  enabled: false
```

#### Network Mode (Multi-Server)

```yaml
network-mode:
  enabled: false # set to true on ONE server only in a network
  poll-interval: 10 # how often to sync reports from the database (seconds)
```

- **enabled**: If `true`, this server will poll the database for reports from all servers.
- **poll-interval**: The frequency of database checks. Recommended: 5-10.

#### Core Settings

```yaml
bot-token: "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"
channel-id: "YOUR_CHANNEL_ID_HERE"
log-channel-id: "YOUR_LOG_CHANNEL_ID_HERE"
```

- Sends reports and status updates directly to Discord.

## 11. Analytics & Telemetry

### bStats

[![NuviraMCReports usage graph](https://bstats.org/signatures/bukkit/NuviraMCReports.svg)](https://bstats.org/plugin/bukkit/NuviraMCReports/28310)

### FastStats

NuviraMCReports also uses **FastStats** for advanced, real-time plugin analytics. The following custom metrics are tracked to help guide future development:

| Metric                  | Description                                            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `pending_reports`       | Number of currently pending reports on the server      |
| `total_reports`         | Total reports ever created on the server               |
| `gui_provider`          | Which GUI type the server uses (`book` or `container`) |
| `db_backend`            | Which database backend is in use (`file` or `mysql`)   |
| `configured_categories` | How many report categories the server has set up       |
| `discord_integration`   | Whether the Discord bot is enabled (`true`/`false`)    |

All telemetry is anonymous — no player data, usernames, IPs, or personally identifiable information is ever collected.
